Hi I'm John Helveston, and thanks for tuning in to my lightning talk on how to make R-powered surveys with {formr}

If you're a researcher or educator, at some point you may need to create survey.

The first place you might turn to are some of the free platforms out there, like Survey Monkey or Google Forms.

These platforms work great for simple surveys - they're easy to use, relatively secure, and getting the data from them is pretty straightforward.

But what if you wanted to make a more complex survey, like one where questions are randomly displayed for each respondent, or where respondents can be shown interactive feedback about their responses?

Well, thankfully some really clever folks at the George Elias Muller Institute created formr, which uses R and RMarkdown to create interactive surveys.

Just for full disclosure, I am not part of the developer team for formr.

Formr was developed by Cyril Tata and Ruben Arslan.

I'm just a big fan of the platform, so I made this talk to share it with the rest of the R universe and demonstrate a few ways of how I've used it.

So what can formr do?

Well, think of it like Survey Monkey plus RMarkdown.

You can use it field simple surveys, but you can also use R code to generate a much richer set of customized survey features.

???

For example, you could insert code chunks to generate interactive charts that the survey respondent can experience.

---

Or you could use R code to generate dynamic feedback about a respondent's answers. In this example, I'm showing the respondent how their risk preferences compare to those of others based on their answers to previous questions.

So how does it work?

Formr relies on Googlesheets to input the main content for each survey.

Here's an example of a simple survey Googlesheet.

Each row is an item that will be displayed on the survey.

Each column controls what will be shown.

---
class: center, middle
background-image: url(images/googlesheet1.png)
background-size: contain

???

The "label" column is where you insert markdown or code chunks that you want to display in the survey.

---
class: center, middle
background-image: url(images/googlesheet2.png)
background-size: contain

???

The "type" column is where you set the type of each question to show. 

You can choose from a long list of options, like multiple choice, text entry, or simply just display text. 

---
class: center, middle
background-image: url(images/googlesheet3.png)
background-size: contain

???

Depending on the type of question, you may also have some options for respondents to choose from.

---
class: center, middle
background-image: url(images/googlesheet4.png)
background-size: contain

???

And you can also customize the look and feel with some styling options

---

<img src="images/screenshot-upload.png" width=1000>

]

???

Once you've got your spreadsheet ready, you can go to formr.org, input the link to your Googlesheet, and your code will be compiled into a survey.

Here is one page from the example sheet I just showed you where I'm ask a multiple choice question.

I'd like to spend the last couple minutes of this talk showing how I've used formr in my own work. 

Specifically, I've used formr to show people randomized images in a research method known as conjoint analysis, and I've also used it to create timed, randomized quizzes for my classes that I teach at George Washington University.
